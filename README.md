# Connecting Google Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Networks

Overview of Connection Methods

Google Cloud provides various methods to connect your Google VPC networks to other networks, including on-premises networks and networks in other clouds. Here are the main options:

Cloud VPN and Cloud Router

# Cloud VPN:

Creates a secure “tunnel” connection over the internet.
Suitable for basic VPN connections.

# Cloud Router:

Dynamically exchanges route information between Google VPC and other networks using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
Automatically updates routes when new subnets are added.
Peering Options

# Direct Peering:

Establishes a connection by placing a router in the same public data center as a Google point of presence.
Allows for direct traffic exchange between networks.
Not covered by a Google Service Level Agreement (SLA).

# Carrier Peering:

Connects on-premises networks to Google Cloud products through a service provider's network.
Provides direct access via public IP addresses.
Dedicated Interconnect and Partner Interconnect

# Dedicated Interconnect:

Provides direct, private connections to Google.
Offers SLA coverage of up to 99.99% if topologies meet Google’s specifications.
Can be backed up by VPN for added reliability.

# Partner Interconnect:

Connects an on-premises network to a VPC network through a supported service provider.
Ideal for locations that cannot reach a Dedicated Interconnect facility or do not require a full 10 Gbps connection.
Offers SLA coverage similar to Dedicated Interconnect, but relies on the service provider for certain aspects.
Cross-Cloud Interconnect
Cross-Cloud Interconnect:
Establishes high-bandwidth dedicated connectivity between Google Cloud and another cloud service provider.
Supports multicloud strategies with reduced complexity and encrypted site-to-site data transfer.
Available in 10 Gbps or 100 Gbps options.

# Key Terminology

VPN (Virtual Private Network): Creates a secure connection over the internet.

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol): A protocol for exchanging routing information between different networks.

Peering: Directly connecting two networks to exchange traffic.

SLA (Service Level Agreement): A commitment to a certain level of service availability and reliability.

Interconnect: Direct physical connections between networks for improved performance and reliability.

# What is the primary function of Cloud Router in Google Cloud?

A) To provide internet access to VMs
B) To dynamically exchange route information using BGP
C) To manage firewall rules
D) To enable cross-region load balancing

Correct Answer: B) To dynamically exchange route information using BGP
Explanation: Cloud Router uses BGP to dynamically exchange route information between Google VPC and other networks.

# Which connection method provides the highest SLA coverage for interconnection with Google Cloud?

A) Direct Peering
B) Cloud VPN
C) Dedicated Interconnect
D) Carrier Peering

Correct Answer: C) Dedicated Interconnect
Explanation: Dedicated Interconnect offers SLA coverage of up to 99.99% if the connections meet Google’s specifications.

# What is a key benefit of using Cross-Cloud Interconnect?

A) It is limited to Google Cloud regions
B) It reduces complexity and supports multicloud strategies
C) It only supports low-bandwidth connections
D) It requires a third-party service provider

Correct Answer: B) It reduces complexity and supports multicloud strategies
Explanation: Cross-Cloud Interconnect helps simplify connectivity and supports multicloud strategies by providing dedicated connections between Google Cloud and other cloud service providers.
